## Usage
  
  Users can search for books using the search bar or Login/Signup using the login/signup button.

  If they search for a book without being logged in they can still see the books, but aren't able to see the button to save the books.

  The login/signup button brings up a modal that toggles between login and signup.

  The login modal has inputs for email and password and the signup modal has inputs for username, email, and password.

  Once logged in you can save books after searching for them and you can view your view your saved books by using the saved books link in the navbar.

  If you have any saved books you will see them displayed and you are able to remove them from your saved books using the delete button.

  You can access the deployed application here: https://googlebooks-collection.onrender.com
